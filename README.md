This is a solution in progress from "Get Programming in Go".

The need is to create an app that generates ten random travel tickets with calculated pricing to Mars based on trip type and speed.

The book does not make mention of structs yet, but a ticket seemed like a good idea for a struct. Literally my first actual Go app, so I am sure there is much I have yet to learn.
